Ansible playbook(s) for managing and updating a collection of (Debian based) Linux instances from a lifecycle management perspective. Principally focused around simplifying updates across an estate, but with a view to include future tasks for things like gathering and reporting on particular "health items" across an estate. Repo is so named cause I just want to press a button and it's all done for me.
